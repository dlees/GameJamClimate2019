Plug this RangeValueBar prefab under your object
that contains your range value. Add the RangeValueBar
as a listener to your RangeValue.

Works by Foreground bar x size being set to 
range value normalized to Background x

Change the foreground x pivot to .5 to expand from 
center

Incomplete feature: Increasing the horizontal
size of the bar doesn't work unless you manually
edit them.
- If the background bar would stretch horizontal
it would work, but this causes the background to
come to the front for some reason.
